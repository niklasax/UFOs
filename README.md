## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to get a build a webapp complete with the HTML framework, CSS styling and Javascript functionality.

## Instructions to use
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

The information on the page goes from more broad to more specific, starting with the title, giving an overview then finally a list of filterable data at the end (Title and overview on 1st picture). To use the webpage, input the address then filter the results to return the desired to data. For example, if you wanted to see UFO spotting results from TX you would filter input 'Enter Country' on tx (example on 2nd picture).
